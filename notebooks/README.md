# Before Running:
1. run `python run.py data features` to produce the data used in the notebooks

# Things to Note:
- only skim `model_training_evaluation.ipynb` for a rough structure of our work
  - run `run.py` for a proper experience of our work
  - explore scripts in `src/main` and `src\helper` for documentation
- available notebooks were used for experimental development and quick testing
  - as such, they lack proper organization and documentation (messy)
- available notebooks are not up to date with the functionality and calculations done through `run.py`
