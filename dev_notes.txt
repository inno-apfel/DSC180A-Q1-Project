HOW TO RUN
-----------

Run all code from run.py
- ex: run 'python run.py data' to process/re-process all data instead of running the development notebook



EXTRA NOTES
-----------

Ensure all notebook work is pushed to main correctly
- run 'Restart & Run All' to ensure the notebook runs sequentially
- then run 'Restart & Clear Output' to ensure only code changes are reflected on github

All file paths for code under 'src' assume calling from the root folder
- follow this assumption when developing new code
- do not hard code '../'s to go up a directory
